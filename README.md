This notebook will outline the steps and calculations I make in order to demonstrate the time evolved spectrum of an accretion disk orbiting a central force. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lL4e6DEQs8NYyOfFLo6r6FMP-hy96MiX?usp=sharing    [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aweb23/radiation_project/blob/main/disk_spectrum.ipynb)  

You can run the notebook on Google Colaboratory by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph. You will need to sign in with your Google account. Execute the whole notebook by clicking on Run all from the Runtime menu (you will click on Run anyway if an authorship warning appears). You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired. Open In Colab

It is also possible to run the notebook on Binder. To do so, click on the launch binder badge at the end of this paragraph. It will take a few minutes to build the appropriate environment, but once done, you can click on the plot_reaction_xml.ipynb notebook to launch it. Binder

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer. To do so, once you have installed the Jupyter Notebook, download the linked notebook above (right-click or control-click). To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

jupyter notebook plot_reaction_xml.ipynb

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not .ipynb on the notebook file you download. For example, some browsers will by default add a .txt to the downloaded file so that it has suffix .ipynb.txt. Remove the .txt before running.
